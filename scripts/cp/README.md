This module implements a Constraint Programming (CP) approach for solving stable matching problems. The implementation is based on the following paper:

- Z. Sun, N. Yamada, Y. Takenami, D. Moriwaki, and M. Yokoo. Stable matchings in practice: A constraint programming approach. In *Proceedings of the 38th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2024)*, pages 22377â€“22384, 2024.

The CP solver uses Google's OR-Tools library for constraint programming.
